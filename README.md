 My aunt has always wanted to launch Schoolhouse Kitchen out of our family house in Vermont. COVID led her to extended time, during which she bottled maple sugar for the first time. Through this, the first bottled product of the Schoolhouse Kitchen was created. The area in which this is is also an often forgotten or just unknown part of the country, but it is wonderful and should always have more visitors!
